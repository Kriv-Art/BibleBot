      "description": "The ASV has long been regarded by many scholars as the most literal English translation since the King James Version—maybe the most literal translation ever. This has made the translation very popular for careful English Bible study, but not for ease of reading. While the KJV was translated entirely from “western manuscripts,” the ASV 1901 was influenced also by the older “eastern manuscripts” that form the basis for most of our modern English translations. Because the ASV 1901 is very difficult to find in print, Logos is pleased to be able to preserve and distribute this significant work. This is an excellent choice for comparative English study.",

It is the culmination of three decades of collaboration by academic scholars and rabbis representing the three largest branches of organized Judaism in America. They drew upon the latest findings in linguistics and archaeology as well as the work of early rabbinic and medieval commentators, grammarians, and philologians. The resulting text is a triumph of literary style and biblical scholarship, unsurpassed in accuracy and clarity.",

      "description": "According to Bruce M. Metzger, this edition was “the most noteworthy critical edition of the Greek Testament ever produced by British scholarship.” They presented what is doubtless the oldest and purest text that could be attained with the means of information available in their day. They took the critical methodology which was then in nascent form, refined it, and applied it to the various texts, producing the classification system which is still in use today; their evaluation of the various texts and text families, almost unchanged, is still accepted. This text, published in 1881, is the first modern critical text and as such the ancestor of the NA/UBS text. It is of use to those interested in the history of textual scholarship and to those who do serious critical work. This particular edition of the 1881 Westcott and Hort text contains morphological analysis contributed by Dr. Maurice Robinson.",
